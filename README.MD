# How to implement a custom XPO connection provider for AdoNetCore.AseClient

This example demonstrates how to implement a custom XPO connection provider for [AdoNetCore.AseClient](https://github.com/DataAction/AdoNetCore.AseClient) - a .NET Core DB Provider for SAP ASE.

The example contains two projects:
* DevExpress.Xpo.AseClientCore - .NET Standard 2.0 library with the provider.
* TestingConsoleProject - .NET Core 3.1 Console Application, which uses [XPO for .NET Core](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/) and AdoNetCore.AseClient to connect to the SAP ASE database.
